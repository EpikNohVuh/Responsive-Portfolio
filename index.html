          <hr />
          <p>
            In Sept of 2000, a love of sound files in chat rooms, born
            ILoveWavs.com. Within a couple of years, ILoveMidis.com followed.
            Both built with basic HTML and a lot of tables and cells, but the
            love of website building came alive.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2003, an at home business was created, and my experience with
            html brought about a website for that business, AllDayBouncers.com.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, my creative side also brought me to be self-taught on
            how to use Photoshop to make custom logos and tiled backgrounds.
          </p>

          <p>
            My past hobby has brought me to pursuit the knowledge to become
            full-stack web developer in technologies including JavaScript, CSS,
            HTML, Node.js.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am excited to use my Above-The-Fold knowledge and web developer
            skills to make beautiful interactive user friendly websites,
          </p>

          <p>
            My Motto: "Never Stop Learning"... and always make an attempt to
            improve. Always be humble, you may know more than someone else and
            you can share your knowledge and experiences, however there will
            always be someone that has more knowledge than you and you hope they
            will share their knowledge with you.
